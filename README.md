**EventManager** is a tool that helps you ensure communication between the elements on your game logic. In other words, it makes it easier to **notify key events to your GameObjects**. 

For example, when the game is over, you want to notify every enemy to stop attacking the player. With EventManager, you can simply **trigger the event** "OnGameOver" and **every element in the game that is subscribed** to this event (in this case, the enemies) **will be notified** of such event and react accordingly.
